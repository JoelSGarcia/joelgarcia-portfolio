# joelgarcia-portfolio

## Project Overview

This portfolio website, hosted at (https://www.joelgarcia.me/), showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a student at the University of Iowa, pursuing a B.B.A. in Business Analytics & Information Systems. The site features a sleek black and gold design, reflecting my school colors, and includes sections for my bio, projects, resume, and contact information. It was developed as part of the BAIS:3300 - Digital Product Management course, specifically for Sprints 1 and 2, completed on May 15, 2025.

## Purpose

The project fulfills the requirements of Sprints 1 and 2 and 3 for BAIS:3300, focusing on building a functional, accessible, and legally compliant portfolio website. Sprint 1 involved creating the initial site with a resume page, while Sprint 2 added legal policies (Terms & Conditions, Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy), a cookie popup, favicon, social media meta tags, and a Google Analytics campaign URL. The goal was to create a professional online presence, learn web development fundamentals, and ensure compliance with accessibility and legal standards.

## What I Learned

As a beginner in web development, this project was a transformative learning experience. Here’s what I gained:

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Basics**: I learned to structure web pages with HTML, style them with CSS (e.g., using Flexbox for layout, gradients for buttons), and add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., the cookie popup functionality).
- **Version Control with GitHub**: I mastered using GitHub Desktop to manage my project, creating branches (e.g., `feature/resume-page`, `feature/social-media-favicon`), committing changes, and pushing to my repository. This taught me the importance of version control in collaborative projects.
- **Azure Deployment**: Deploying my site to Azure Static Web Apps was a new skill. I learned to integrate Azure with GitHub Actions for automatic deployment, making my site live at `joelgarcia.me`.
- **Accessibility and Validation**: I ensured my site met WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards using the WAVE tool, and validated HTML5 and CSS3 using W3C validators. This taught me the importance of accessibility in web design.
- **Google Analytics and Campaign Tracking**: I set up Google Analytics to track visitors and created a campaign URL (`https://joelgarcia.me/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=portfolio-promotion`) to monitor traffic from my LinkedIn promotion.
- **Legal Compliance**: Adding policy pages and a cookie popup introduced me to the legal aspects of web development, such as user consent and privacy policies.
- **Problem-Solving and Debugging**: Troubleshooting issues like DNS propagation for my custom domain and ensuring cross-browser compatibility (e.g., favicon display) honed my debugging skills.
- **Project Management**: Managing tasks across two sprints taught me to prioritize, break down complex goals, and meet deadlines, skills I’ll carry forward in my career.

## Why I Enjoyed Creating This Project

Building this portfolio website was incredibly rewarding for several reasons:

- **Creative Expression**: Designing the site with my school colors (black and gold) allowed me to express my identity and creativity. I loved experimenting with CSS gradients and hover effects to make the buttons visually appealing.
- **Sense of Achievement**: Seeing my site go live at `joelgarcia.me` after deploying to Azure was a proud moment. As a beginner, I was amazed at how I could create a professional-looking website from scratch.
- **Learning New Skills**: Each task, from adding a favicon to setting up Google Analytics, introduced me to new concepts. I enjoyed the challenge of learning and applying these skills, especially since I had no prior web development experience.
- **Real-World Application**: Knowing that this portfolio could be a tool to showcase my skills to potential employers made the project meaningful. Sharing it on LinkedIn and tracking visitor data felt like a real-world marketing effort.
- **Support and Growth**: Working through this project with guidance helped me overcome initial overwhelm. I appreciated the structured learning process, which boosted my confidence as a developer and researcher.
